# Introduction

Hi! Thank you for wanting to contribute to this project! It's surreal to me that there's people out there willing to work on OSS projects! You're the best.

### Why these guidelines?

These guidelines are helpful for maintaining the integrity of the project, both on my end and yours. If you show that you respect the guidelines, then I would be a jerk if I didn't show you the same respect by responding to your issue/pull-request/comments.

### Contributions we need.

Anything that you think would be helpful! I will take a look at any and all contributions. The docs could always be better, the code could always be improved, we can never have too many tests. Anything that you think would be helpful would likely be appreciated :).
